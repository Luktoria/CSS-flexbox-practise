<h2>Milano Coffee is located in the tiny village, Felsőzsebalja. We just call it Milano to make it sound more classy. </h2>
<p>Located conveniently just down the train-station, Milano Coffee stands unique in our village. Being the only coffe in Felsőzsebalja, we don't have to be affraid of competition (too much honesty might just end our business though). </p>

            <h3>Local green tea</h3>
            <p>First of all, our coffee is proud to present its best product, the tea. 100% homegrown leaves, locally sourced.</p>
            <p>(We buy it in the ABC-store nearby)</p>

            <p>Our selection of tea cakes, biscuits and cookies are made by our lovely (and very bored) grandmothers. The products change day by day, depending on what the grannies feel like baking that day.</p>

            <h3>Local coffee</h3>
            <p>Okay, okay, we don't grow our own coffe-beans (for now, we will see what global warming might do in the future). But we do grind them locally, with local workforce and locally-made grinder machine! </p>
